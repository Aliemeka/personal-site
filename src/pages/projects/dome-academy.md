# Dome Academy

Dome Academy is a community-focused educational platform designed to help developers enhance their skills through hands-on project-based learning.

## The Problem

Traditional learning platforms often focus on theory without enough practical application. Developers need a space where they can learn by doing, collaborate with others, and build a portfolio of real projects.

## The Solution

Dome Academy bridges this gap by offering:

- Project-based courses that result in portfolio-worthy applications
- Community support and mentorship
- Professional development resources for career advancement
- Practical exercises that mirror real-world scenarios

## Technologies Used

The platform is built using a modern tech stack:

- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, routing, and optimized performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: For streamlined styling and consistent design
- **Firebase**: For authentication and database management
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting

## Lessons Learned

Building Dome Academy has taught me valuable lessons about creating educational platforms that genuinely help developers grow:

1. Community is just as important as content
2. Practical application beats theory-only learning
3. Feedback loops accelerate skill development
4. Creating an inclusive environment benefits everyone
