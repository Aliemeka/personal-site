# Why I'm Learning Hardware in 2025

## Introduction

In this blog post, I want to share my journey into the world of hardware. As a software developer, I've always been fascinated by how things work under the hood. Recently, I decided to dive deeper into hardware to expand my knowledge and skills.

## The Motivation

### Previous Background

During my time at university, I had the opportunity to work with PIC microcontrollers and Arduino. I built a number of mini projects that helped me understand the basics of hardware programming and interfacing. These experiences laid the foundation for my current journey into more advanced hardware topics.

### Bridging the Gap

Understanding hardware allows me to bridge the gap between software and the physical world. It helps me write more efficient code and optimize performance by knowing how the underlying hardware operates.

### Curiosity and Passion

I've always been curious about electronics and how devices are built. Learning hardware satisfies this curiosity and fuels my passion for technology.

## The Journey

### Getting Started

I began by researching and purchasing some basic hardware components like microcontrollers, sensors, and breadboards. I also enrolled in online courses and joined hardware communities to learn from others.

### Hands-On Projects

To apply my knowledge, I started working on small projects such as building simple circuits, creating IoT devices, and experimenting with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

### I want to Build a Consumer Product

Building a consumer product has always been a dream of mine. I want to create something that people can use in their daily lives, something that solves a real problem. This goal drives me to learn more about hardware design, prototyping, and manufacturing processes. By combining my software skills with hardware knowledge, I believe I can bring innovative products to life.

## Resources

### Books

- "Make: Electronics" by Charles Platt
- "The Art of Electronics" by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill

### Online Communities

- [Stack Exchange Electronics](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/)
- [Reddit Electronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/)

### Tutorials

- [SparkFun Tutorials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials)
- [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

### Programming Languages

- **C**: Essential for programming microcontrollers and embedded systems.
- **Python**: Great for scripting and working with platforms like Raspberry Pi.
- **Assembly**: Useful for understanding low-level hardware operations.
- **Verilog/VHDL**: Important for hardware description and FPGA programming.
- **Embedded Rust**: A systems programming language that ensures memory safety and concurrency without a garbage collector.

## Challenges and Rewards

### Overcoming Obstacles

Learning hardware has its challenges, such as understanding complex schematics and debugging hardware issues. However, these obstacles have taught me patience and problem-solving skills.

### Cost and Expenses

Investing in hardware can be expensive. Components, tools, and development boards add up quickly. To manage costs, I prioritize essential items and look for discounts or second-hand options. Additionally, I try to repurpose components from old electronics to save money.

### Sense of Accomplishment

Successfully completing a hardware project brings a great sense of accomplishment. Seeing a physical device work as intended is incredibly rewarding.

## Conclusion

Learning hardware has been a fulfilling experience that complements my software development skills. It has opened up new opportunities and broadened my understanding of technology. I encourage other developers to explore hardware and discover the exciting possibilities it offers.
